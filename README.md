# Just De Pic

A lightweight, offline image metadata tool that does one thing well - removes/edits metadata from your images without uploading them anywhere.

> [!NOTE]
> Coded to life with some help from Claude 4 Opus

## Features

### Privacy First

- No analytics, no tracking, no BS

### Folder Mode

- Multi-select with Ctrl/Shift+Click
- Visual selection feedback

### Single Image Mode
- Detailed metadata inspection (EXIF, IPTC, XMP)
- Edit individual metadata fields
- Full-size preview
- Real-time updates

### Core Operations
- **Remove Metadata**: Strip all metadata with one click
- **Resize**: Downscale images while maintaining aspect ratio
- **Crop**: Center-crop to specific dimensions
- **Batch Processing**: Apply operations to multiple images at once

### Technical Features
- Automatically sets up virtual environment

## Why I Built This

I got tired of:
- Uploading personal photos to random websites just to check/remove metadata
- Installing bloated software with "premium features" for basic tasks
- Not having a simple, trustworthy tool for a simple job
- If you want something more feature-rich, use [Phil Harvey's EXIF Tool](https://github.com/FrankBijnen/ExifToolGui)

- Built with [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) for image processing
- [piexif](https://github.com/hMatoba/Piexif) for EXIF handling
- Tkinter for keeping it simple and cross-platform
